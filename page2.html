      <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
      <h3>Inital Interest:</h3>
      <p>I have loved programming since the first time I was really exposed to it. When I get started on a program, I can spend hours and hours on it without even realising how long it’s been.
      <br>My interest in IT first started when I took an introduction to computing fundamentals class at my previous university. At the time I was a first year Chemical Engineering student and it was the first time I had been exposed to coding in my life. It was the only class I wanted to spend time on that entire semester, and I continued to tutor friends of mine who were struggling with the course for the next few semesters as well. That ended up triggering a change of my major from Chemical Engineering to Computer Engineering the very next semester.
      <br>Prior to taking the class I never would have even considered studying or working in IT. I had gotten the wrong idea of what programming was from movies and TV shows. I thought that programming was something lame that nerds did, turns out I’m one of those nerds!
      </p>

      <h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
      <p>I didn’t really choose RMIT, it chose me. After dropping out of my university in Jordan I applied to many Universities here in Melbourne through VTAC but received no offers. I ended up receiving an offer for a Certificate IV in IT and thinking it was my only choice I accepted and started on that for a couple of months. I then discovered Open Universities Australia and reached out to see what options I may have, and they suggested I take a few prerequisite courses with RMIT and then apply for the actual degree. So, having no other options RMIT was my only choice.</p>

      <h3>Expectations:</h3>
      <p>I expect to learn things across all the areas of information technology, including artificial intelligence, programming languages, cloud computing, data management, mobile computing etc. I also expect to learn how to apply all this knowledge practically into creating applications and web pages. I hope to have a lot of interesting projects to work on throughout my studies as I prefer to learn through practical methods rather than theoretical.</p>  </main>
