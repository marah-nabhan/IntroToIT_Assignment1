      <h2>Project Idea</h2>
      <h3>Overview: </h3>
      <p>My project idea is to create an application that compares all the different online stores, applications, and websites. The application would compare many aspects of these stores. It would compare the prices of the same or similar items, the quality of these items and the ingredients or materials used to make the product, it would also compare the companies themselves on how environmentally friendly they are and how ethically they conduct their business. The application will compare groceries, clothing, food delivery, toys, furniture, and anything else that you can buy online.</p>

      <h3>Motivation:</h3>
      <p>Personally, I often feel overwhelmed by the huge number of options of online shopping there is these days and I often feel hopeless when trying to compare all these options while trying to find the best deal, that’s also good quality, while also wanting to buy from environmentally friendly and ethical companies. If I could find a comparison of everything on one page at the same time it would save me a lot of time and stress.
      <br>There’s been an increase in online shopping over the last few years thank to COVID.  “Australians spent a total of $4.2 billion online in August 2021 according to Finder analysis of ABS data. This represents a 36% increase over the previous year and an incredible 114% increase over the same period in 2019. Online shopping was already on a steady incline, and the pandemic has only fast-tracked this growth.” An application like this would be very useful to people who enjoy shopping online, especially with how much more environmentally and ethically conscious mankind is becoming, and even if not for those reasons it would help them find the best deals and best quality items.
      </p>

      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>The application will compare many aspects of different online shopping stores. It will compare the level of environmental friendliness, ethical business practices, prices, quality of products, materials or ingredients used to create the products. The application will give ratings for the different components with detailed descriptions for the reasoning behind each rating so that users can find what they want depending on their own unique requirements.
      <br>To compare ethical business practices, the application will give each store a rating out of 10 depending on many aspects. Some of the aspects might be employee reviews, diversity (people from all backgrounds, people of colour, all genders, ages, sexualities) of employees (specifically those in higher positions), whether they use ethical suppliers or not, fair compensation of employees, diversity of employees getting promoted, companies code of ethics/ value statement, employee loyalty, use of Fairtrade products and possibly more. Unfortunately, the rating for ethical business practices may be highly opinion based unless the company has gone through public legal issues regarding their past unethical practices.
      <br>To compare environmental practices, the application will again give each store a rating out of 10 depending on many aspects. An eco-friendly business should support charitable causes, even if it’s a smaller company that doesn’t mean they can’t contribute. Environmentally conscious companies will also reduce reliance on natural resources, it is important that businesses are finding ways to cut back on paper, wood, or any other raw material usage as much as possible. Another way to reduce waste is by using recycled and recyclable products as well as reusing materials in ways like using both sides of a sheet of paper, using reusable water bottles, storing manuals and other documents online.
      <br>To compare quality of products, the application will give each store and each item a rating out of 10 depending on many aspects. The store will be given a quality rating dependant on customer satisfaction of their products in general as well as quality of materials the store uses in its products. The quality of individual items will be rated according to the quality of materials used in making the products, customer reviews, performance and features where applicable, durability and possibly more. Customers will be able to view items order from highest to lowest rating or vice versa.
      <br>To compare prices, the application will compare prices of the same product or similar product from different stores as well as comparing those prices dependant on unit where applicable. Users will be able to see products order by lowest/highest price or lowest/highest per unit price depending on their preference.
      <br>Once every aspect of a product and its retailer has been given a rating users will have the option to search for products order according to the highest individual rating, the highest overall rating, or the highest rating according to a combination of their own choosing. A feature allowing users to view items or stores ordered according to specific features e.g., durability may be added. Users will also be able to leave reviews whether they agree with the given rating or not, in case of a   high number of users disagreeing with a given rating it will be put under review.

      <h3>Tools and Technologies:</h3>
      <p>Cross-platform mobile app development coding platform like Xamarin or Appcelerator to be able to develop an app for more than one mobile operating system simultaneously as well as use the sae code base for different platforms. Coding platforms also provide full control over the entire development process. All that it is required is an app development tool and programmers with the skills required to create the application and conduct web/scraping or the integration of APIs to acquire the required information from other websites and applications for comparison.</p>

      <h3>Skill Required:</h3>
      <p>The skills that are required to produce this application are mainly proficiency in programming language such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is no special hardware required for the application and. The suggested application isn’t overly complicated and therefore it is very feasible t to find the skills and software required to develop it. </p>

      <h3>Outcome:</h3>
      <p>If the project is successful users of the application will be able to find the perfect place for their online shopping depending on their own specific needs, whether it be to shop at stores with ethical business practices or stores that are environmentally conscious or simply the stores with the best deals. This application will solve the problem of having to waste a lot of time shopping around and researching different stores individually and trying to figure out which one is the best. This development can be very helpful in leading people to shop at more ethical and environmentally friendly stores while also getting the best deals and best quality products possible.</p>
