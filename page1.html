      <h2>Introduction:</h2>
      <p>My name is Marah, I’m 24 years old and I have three siblings; two sisters and a brother. I am a dual citizen; Australian and Jordanian and I moved to Melbourne in February of 2022. I currently live here with my brother who is a year younger than me.
      <br>Before moving to Melbourne, I was living in Amman, Jordan in the Middle East and I speak both English and Arabic fluently. I was born in Doha Qatar and have also lived in Sydney previously. Something I think is interesting is that each one of my siblings and I was born in one of the places we’ve lived throughout our childhood. My older sister was born in the city of Amman in Jordan, I was born in the city of Doha in Qatar, my brother was born in Melbourne and my little sister was born in Sydney.
      <br>I’ve been studying for a very long time, but the highest certificate I have achieved so far is a High School Diploma. I graduated High School in Jordan in 2016 and studied a Computer Engineering major for four years on and off at the German Jordanian University in Jordan before I had to drop out due to some family circumstances. I am now trying to get back on track to getting a degree in IT by taking some units through Open Universities Australia in hopes of the leading to a degree in Information Technology from RMIT.
