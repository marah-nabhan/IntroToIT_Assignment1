      <h3>16Personalities Test:</h3>
      <p>I was sceptical when I first saw the result of the 16personalities test. The test gave me a result of an adventurer which I didn’t believe I was, I see myself as kind of a boring person most of the time. However, when I read more details about this result, I realised that it was quite accurate, especially when it came to teamwork.
      <br>An adventurer personality type is very comfortable working among equals such as colleagues, giving or receiving advice to solve problems where needed and pulling their own weight. While at the same time it can be exhausting if their role requires a lot of social interaction.
      <br>The adventurer personality type also excels in management positions. The adventurer isn’t a personality type that enjoys having control over others or having a disciplinary position yet they’re still well suited to leadership positions. Adventurers are sensitive which allows them to be great listeners which allows them to properly figure out what position or work their subordinates are suited to.
      <br><br>
      I think the results of the 16personalities test show that I will be an ideal team member. I believe that this result suggests that I will pull my weight in a team without butting heads with anyone else. I will be helpful when necessary and keep to myself when needed.
      <br>I believe it also suggests that I can take up a leadership position, if necessary, but I do not feel a need to be in a leadership position. Therefore, if there is someone in the team that really wants to be the leader of the team, I won’t cause any problems. On the other hand, if no one else on the team wants to take a leadership role I can step up.
      <br><br>
      The result of the 16personalities test shows that I should strive to form a team of equals who will each pull their own weight while also working together and helping each other when needed.

      <h3>Learning Style Test:</h3>
      <p>I believe the learning style test was very accurate in saying I have a tactile learning style. I have seen that the easiest way for me to learn is by touching and doing. I’ve always preferred practical classes over theoretical ones. I think this learning style is very suitable for an Information Technology student since the best way to get better at programming is to practice writing code.
      <br><br>
      The result of the learning style test suggests that I probably won’t be too involved with others on the teams as I will need to spend a lot of time doing hands on work to get my part of the project done since this is a project for a class that I am still studying.
      <br><br>
      The results of the learning style test suggest that the team I form should be a group of independent workers since as a tactile learner I require frequent breaks and to move around and that can be very distracting and unproductive for other people.</p>

      <h3>What this means for forming a team:</h3>
      <p>I believe the leadership style test was mostly accurate in deeming me a ‘Front-Line Leader’, except for a few minor details. I see myself as a very empathetic and present person. I prefer to be around and helpful rather than simply handing out orders and expecting everything to get done. The detail I don’t agree with is that I’m a storyteller which I don’t think I am in the slightest.
      <br>I believe that this result is very close to the 16personalities test result which confirms the accuracy of both tests.
      <br><br>
      If put in a leadership position, I will not be the kind of leader that hands out assignments and just expects everything to get done. I would be the type of leader that will lend a hand when needed and make sure that everything is going smoothly throughout.
      <br><br>
      Although I do not completely agree and it completely contradicts what I think the learning style test means, the results of the leadership style test suggest that if I’m going to have a leadership position in the team that I should try to form a team that prefers to work together through all aspects of a project rather than everyone doing their own thing and then putting it all together.
